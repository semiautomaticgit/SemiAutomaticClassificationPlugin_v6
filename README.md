# Semi Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP)

The Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) is a free open source plugin for QGIS that allows for the semi-automatic classification (also supervised and unsupervised classification) of remote sensing images. Also, it provides several tools for the download of free images (Landsat, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, ASTER, MODIS), the preprocessing of images, the postprocessing of classifications, and the raster calculation.

## Using the plugin

The plugin is available to QGIS version 2.x and to QGIS 3.x.
